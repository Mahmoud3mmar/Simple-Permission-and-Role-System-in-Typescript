# Simple-Permission-and-Role-System-in-Typescript
You are tasked with enhancing the security of a blogging platform by implementing a basic permission and role system. This system should control access to different API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.

# Roles and Permissions Documentation

## User Roles:

### Admin:
- Full access to all API endpoints.

### User:
- Can create new posts.
- Can edit their own posts.
- Can view all posts.

## Permissions:

### Create Post:
- Allows the user to create new posts.

### Edit Post:
- Allows the user to edit their own posts.

### Delete Post:
- Allows the admin to delete any post.

## Accessible API Endpoints:

- **GET /posts:**
  - Accessible to both Admin and User.
  - Returns all posts.

- **POST /posts:**
  - Accessible to User.
  - Creates a new post.

- **GET /posts/GetAllPostsWithOwnersInfo:**
  - Accessible to both Admin only.
  - Returns all posts with owners' information.

- **DELETE /posts/:id:**
  - Accessible to Admin only.
  - Deletes a post by ID.

- **PUT /posts/:id:**
  - Accessible to User.
  - Updates a post by ID.

## Authentication and Authorization Flow:

- The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.
- Input Validation:Joi can be used to validate incoming data, such as user input from forms or requests. 
- Users must be authenticated to access any API endpoint.
- Roles are assigned to users during registration or based on the application's business logic.
- Authorization middleware checks the user's role and permissions before allowing access to specific endpoints.
- The system responds with appropriate error messages for unauthorized access or invalid operations.

## Important Notes:

- Ensure proper authentication is implemented to secure the endpoints.
- Authorization middleware must be configured correctly to check roles and permissions.
- Regularly review and update roles and permissions based on application requirements.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the roles, permissions, and accessible API endpoints in your blogging platform. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific use case and security requirements.
